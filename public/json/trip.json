            It's easy to follow, by the line of red bricks in the sidewalk and by footprints at street crossings. 
            Begin by picking up brochures on the attractions at the Visitor Center in the Boston Common before heading to the State House. 
            The trail will take you to Old Granary Burying Ground (where Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, and John Hancock are buried), 
            King's Chapel Burying Ground (Boston's oldest cemetery with the graves of Governor John Winthrop and two Mayflower passengers), 
            Old South Meeting House (where the ringing speeches of patriots spawned the Boston Tea Party), and the Old State House. 
            This is Boston's oldest public building and the site of the Boston Massacre.
            In the North End, Boston's lively Italian neighborhood, are the Paul Revere House and Old North Church, 
            where lanterns were hung in April 1775 to alert Paul Revere that British troops were headed to Lexington to arrest the patriot leaders and confiscate the munitions supplies. 
            The trail ends across the bridge in Charlestown with the 54-gun frigate USS Constitution -nicknamed 'Old Ironsides' in the War of 1812 - and the 220-foot granite Bunker Hill Monument.",

            The ground floor is still occupied by market stalls; on the upper floor is a council chamber, which in the 18th and 19th centuries was the meeting place of revolutionaries and later, of abolitionists. 
            On its fourth floor is the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Museum, with weaponry, uniforms, and paintings of significant battles.
            The adjoining Faneuil Hall Marketplace includes three long halls (Quincy Market, North Market, and South Market), dating from the early 19th century, now occupied by a lively assortment of shops, restaurants, and exhibitions. 
            In good weather, you'll find street performers and buskers putting on shows in the square around the market, and along with the numerous food stalls, there are also shops selling jewelry, clothing, gifts, and souvenirs.",

            You can rent skates to use on the Frog Pond from November through mid-March, enjoy the spring blossoms and fall foliage colors reflecting in its surface, 
            and in summer, watch youngsters splash about in the wading pool.
            Adjoining it on the west side of Charles Street, is the 24-acre Public Garden, America's oldest botanical garden, 
            as well as Victorian-style monuments and statues, including an equestrian statue of George Washington and popular modern bronzes of a family of ducks immortalized in Robert McCloskey's children's book Make Way for the Ducklings.

            Well-kept brick homes in Federal and Greek Revival styles line its tree-shaded streets, and at its heart is Louisburg Square, where homes face onto a leafy private park. 
            Author Louisa May Alcott lived here from 1880 to 1888. 
            The Nichols House Museum, a Federal-style home by Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, shows how Beacon Hill's upper class residents lived and is filled with collections of 16th- to 19th-century furnishings and decorative arts. 
            At the western foot of Beacon Hill, Charles Street is lined with boutiques and shops that have traditionally catered to the neighborhood and are popular with visitors as well. 
            Beyond Charles Street, facing the Public Garden, The Bull and Finch, established in 1969, inspired the popular television program, Cheers.
            The north side of Beacon Hill is far more modest, and has been home to immigrants, including a sizable African American community, since the early 19th century. 
            National Park Service Rangers offer free guided tours of the Black Heritage Trail from April through November and you can follow the trail on a self-guided tour year round. 
            The Boston African American National Historic Site includes 15 pre-Civil War homes, businesses, schools, and churches that give a picture of Boston's 19th-century African American community.
            The Museum of Afro-American History operates the African Meeting House, the country's oldest (1806) church built by and for Black Americans and now restored to its 1854 appearance. 
            The 1834 Abiel Smith School was the first public grammar school for African American children. 
            Displays at both include artifacts, films, art, and sculpture related to the black experience in Boston and New England.",

            Or you can download a tour from their website. Harvard Yard sits right in Harvard Square, a lively hub for students, 'townies,' and visitors, filled with shops, bookstores, and allegedly more places to buy ice cream than any other U.S.city.
            Adjoining Harvard Yard is the Renzo Piano-designed home of the Harvard Art Museums, including three formerly separate collections, each of which ranked high as major U.S. art museums. 
            Few universities have such enviable collections. Fogg Art Museum concentrates on Italian early-Renaissance art, the Busch-Reisinger on Expressionist art of central and northern Europe, 
            with Bauhaus objects and paintings by Kandinsky and Klee.

            and all so realistic that you will have trouble believing they are made of glass. 
            Created between 1887 and 1936 by artisans Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka, the flowers are unique in the world, and their secret process has never been replicated. 
            These are part of Harvard's massive research collections, shown under one roof in the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, the Mineralogical Museum, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and the Botanical Museum.
            Particularly strong in Native American exhibits, the Peabody shows artifacts and art interpreted as part of a living culture, even when that culture has vanished. 
            You can admire some of the finest examples of Native American arts from many periods and tribes, and also see how these changed as Europeans provided a new market for their goods. 
            Those who like the Victorian 'Cabinet of Curiosities' feel of old traditional museums will love the Pacific Islands balcony - it's like stepping back a century. 
            The Museum of Comparative Zoology, founded by Louis Agassiz in 1859, contains an extensive collection of fossils, including a 25,000-year-old mastodon.

            Trinity is widely considered to be his finest work. The murals, frescoes, and painted decorations inside are by John La Farge and much of the fine stained glass is by Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris. 
            Facing it, across a grassy lawn where you can enjoy a picnic lunch with neighborhood office workers, is the Boston Public Library founded in 1848 as the first publicly funded lending library in the country. 
            Architect Charles Follen McKim designed the present building in 1895. Go inside to see the library's Renaissance Revival architecture and murals by John Singer Sargent and Edwin Abbey.
            On a third side of the square is the venerable Boston institution, the Copley Plaza Hotel, now a Fairmont property; these three buildings, backed by the sheer glass wall of a skyscraper, create a stunning cityscape. 
            A block down Boylston Street, look for the finish line of the Boston Marathon, run each April on Patriot's Day.

            The priceless 2500-piece collection of paintings, sculptures, furniture, tapestries, decorative arts, books, and manuscripts reflect the personal tastes and considerable expertise of Mrs. Gardner herself, whose own flamboyance further adds to the charm of the museum.
            Behind the palazzo, a 70,000-square-foot glass-clad building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano creates new viewpoints for the original palazzo and stunning spaces for music and visual arts, allowing the museum to showcase exceptional contemporary works and artists. 
            Rather than clash or compete with the original building, Piano's wing simply provides a new glass through which to view Mrs. Gardner's palazzo. 
            From almost anywhere in the new building are uninterrupted prospects of the palace and gardens through transparent walls.
